== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The popular posts tab is not showing anything. =

First, you need to have the Jetpack plugin installed and connected to a WordPress.com account. Second, the Stats module has to be activated. And last, this plugin gets the popular posts data from Jetpack Stats module. If the popular posts tab still isn't showing posts, please check the Jetpack Stats first and see if it has any data to show. If data is already there, then get in touch with me.
